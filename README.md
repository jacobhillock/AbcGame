# ABC Game
A game concept developed in the car with my girlfriend. We were talking about the sobriety test that is saying the alphabet backwards. Which prompted the idea of this game.

This game prompts the user with a letter to have them guess the letter before or after it.

The model is developed in such a way that you can extend the game to be 2 before/after, 3 before/after, etc.
